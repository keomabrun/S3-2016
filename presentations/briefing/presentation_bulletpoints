# Presentation

## Slide 1

* make a sticker with a plant that says "Hello world!"

## Slide 2

* Personal presentation (our names)
* The difference in our interests and fields

## Slide 3

* The global idea of our project

* Two parts of the project

	* making a software which activates the water pump according to the data 
          it gets from the moisture sensor

	*sending data from Arduino to the server (RPi) and displaying the data

# Slide 4

* To do this, we need this equipment

* take the picture from the last slide and use arrows to describe what we need

* RPi: a small computer which will be our server

* Arduino: even smaller computer which is more oriented to electronics

* Moisture sensor: a sensor which senses the conductivity of the media it's in

* Water pump: a suction pump which takes in the water from a container 
  and sends it to the plant

* Battery: powers everything

# Slide 5

* mindmap

# Slide 6

*

#Slide 7

* divided into 2 parts:
	* first: next steps (we are sure that we are going to make them)
	* second: improvements (we want to do it if we have the time)

#Slide 8

* remove the mindmap
