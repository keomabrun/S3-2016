Reproducible research

One of the main goals of this project is to show the importance of reproducible research.
This is a kind of research which can be repeated after the initial research.
Currently, this is a big problem in the science community since a lot of research is being done, but not all of them can be repeated.
This is due to unspecified procedures which were used during the research and/or insufficient information about the used equipment and the result of the research.
One of the most popular ways of making research reproducible is using a version control system.
Version control system is a system which is used for remembering all versions of the research.
It remembers the difference between two versions of the same part of the research so the changes are visible and easily readable.
Saving all versions of the research contains data of successes and failures.
This way the same mistakes cannot be made since there are already notes on how they happened and how they could be stopped.
Version control systems encourage originality in a way that they have the option of "branching".
Branching is an event which happens after the research is split into more parts and they concentrate on different aspects of the problem.
This is a useful concept since every branch can access the data which was collected before branching, but cannot see the information other branches have collected. 
Not all research can use a version control system because of the amount of data, complexity of the procedures or the type of research.

On our project, we used Git as a version control system on which we saved all files connected to the project.
Every time we change something, we send the changes we made in our repository on Github ("push") so the current version is saved.
When the changes are monitored, we can see what was the problem and how we solved it.
