# Report 2 (1st August 2016)

## Morning

* We talked about ourselves and made a presentation about our projects and us.

* We downloaded Arduino IDE for our Arduino boards and started coding in the software for Arduino.

* We programmed the LEDs for our boards to blink and needed some soldering to connect the resistors to LEDs.

	* At first we used the Arduino boards for LEDs that were integrated in the boards. Later we added external LEDs, the ones that needed soldering. 
	* After that we used the bread bord to enlarge the circut. We had 2 LEDs on bread board connected with the Arduino.


## Afternoon

* We played with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

	* The software we wrote for our board made our LEDs fade using loops (while, for) and conditional function (if).
	* We used basic functions for the Arduino. More information can be found on the official website.
	* We !dug! the plant from the school backyard and put it in the pot with the soil (we also have ants!)
	* We measured the soil moisture with a moisture sensor and built a software for detecting and reading the data we got from sensor.
