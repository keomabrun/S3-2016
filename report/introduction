INTRODUCTION

# problem
Everyday a huge amount of plants die because of lack of attention and love.
People go into holiday or simply forget due to their constant stress.

# current solutions
The final product can water the plants in apsense of humans and keep them hydrated. 

# our system/product

The goal of the project is to establish an automated system that waters the plant according to its needs without any human intervention.
The whole product has three main sections:
 - the moisture measurement
 - the automated water pumping
 - and the server for self-hosting. 

## Measurements
The moisture sensor measures conductivity of the soil.
The more water there is, the higher the connductivity.

Although, a problem may occur if there is a high amount of metal ions, from the soil itself or accumulated over time from water.
It represents a possible problem because it can effect the conductivity of the soil and cause a higher measurement.
It sends the analog data to the small computer capable of prossesing the data and storing a small software in it.

## Water automation
More precisely, we use Arduino Nano as "small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board" (1 - footnote) for storing and executing our software.
The code is written in C/C++ like language.
The software in Arduino processes the data from the sensor, determines if the value is above or under the defined limit and enables the pump to
water the plant if the value is low.
The limiting value for the pump is defined according to the type of the plant and the type of the soil becouse they effect the conductivity of
the soil wich is measured.
Arduino and the pump together are powered by an external battery via USB port.


## Self-Hosting
At the same time Arduino sends the data from the moisture sensor to the Raspberry Pi via radio frequency.
Raspberry Pi is a small computer similar to the Arduino but more powerful. It has an Ethernet port for connection to the internet.
We use it as web server which stores our data and displays it like a graph in a form of a web page.
Using the web server we can monitor the system from the distance and easily see the current state of the plant according to the graph.
The Raspberry Pi has it's own power source.

# Conclusion of the intro
Our prototype is a turn-key solution currently applicable to personal needs.
The main advantages are the facts that it does not consume a lot of energy and that the whole product is self-contained.

CONCLUSION AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
Our system could be improved to large-scale agricultural watering process monitoring.
Throughout the fields, the water is not spread the same.
That effects the global productivity and quality of the plants used in the industry.
Multiple devices like automated water pumps could measure the moisture of certain parts of the fields and controll the amount of water in those
parts. That way we improve the efficiency of the industrial production.
