#Conclusion

In the Summer School of Science (S3++) our team got an opportunity to take part in a practicle, Computer Science project.
Our main purpose was to set up an automatic watering system with which we succeeded.
Meanwhile we learnt a lot about programming, electronics, Computer Science in general and also about many other fields of science (including Physics and Chemistry).
We assembled an all-in-one automatic watering system and documented in a step-by-step approach so that it can be reproduced by anyone for a few kunas.

Further improvements include:
i) adding additional temperature and humidity sensors,
ii) analysing the interaction between the different metrics,
iii) collecting data about different plants
iv) adding a user friendly interface.
