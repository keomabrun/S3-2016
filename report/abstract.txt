Abstract

On the Summer School of Science 2016 in Pozega on S3++ camp we have been given a problem about an automated watering system for plants.
The goal of our project is to make a completely automated system which provides water to a plant according to its needs.
We solved the problem by making a circuit which involves a water pump and a moisture sensor that are connected to an Arduino Nano.
Arduino Nano controls the water pump according to the data it gets from the moisture sensor.
The produced data is sent to Raspberry Pi from where it is displayed on a web page.
